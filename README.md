# 👩‍🏫 Person Class Hierarchy with Student and Teacher Subclasses

## 🎯 Objective
Understand and apply the concept of **inheritance in JavaScript (ES6 classes)** by creating a base class and extending it into specialized subclasses.  
This strengthens foundational skills in **object-oriented programming** within modern JavaScript.

---

## 📌 Task Description
- Create a base **Person** class with:
  - Properties: `name`, `age`
  - Method: `displayInfo()` to show basic details  

- Create a **Student** subclass (extends Person) with:
  - Extra property: `grade` or `course`
  - Method override or extension to display student details  

- Create a **Teacher** subclass (extends Person) with:
  - Extra property: `subject` or `department`
  - Method override or extension to display teacher details  

- Instantiate objects from both subclasses and demonstrate calling their methods to show **inheritance** and **method overriding**.
